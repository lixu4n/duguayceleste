I'm 4th year student studying Computer Science at the University of Ottawa and I am also pursuing an additional minor in Digital Humanities which expanded my interests in product/porject developpement. I got to explore how computation has transformed culture itself and the convergence of culture being inseperable from technologies and computation.
